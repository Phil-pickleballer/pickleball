      <h1>Confusing Pickleball Rules</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>
        There are many sources for pickleball rules. These are some of the
        weirder and less intuitive rules that may be confusing to players
        already familiar with the game.
      </p>

      <h2>Definitions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A <strong>rally</strong> in pickleball is the continuous back and
          forth that occurs after the service of the ball and before a fault
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>volley</strong> is a ball hit in the air before it bounces
          onto the court during a rally
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>fault</strong> is a rules violation that results in a dead
          ball and the end of a rally
        </li>
        <li>
          The <strong>kitchen</strong> or
          <strong>non-volley zone (NVZ)</strong> is the seven-foot zone on each
          side of the net including all lines defining that area
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Volley Serves
        <span class="h2Note"
          >(ball does not bounce on ground before serve)</span
        >
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          New for 2023: no spin on toss! While some natural rotation of the ball
          is expected during any release of the ball from the hand, the server
          shall not impart spin when tossing the ball. Spin may be imparted by
          the paddle. Prior to 2023, spin on the drop was encouraged
        </li>
        <li>
          When the ball contacts the paddle (1) the ball must be below the
          server's belly button and (2) the entire paddle must be below the
          server's wrist
        </li>
        <li>
          The hit must be at least slightly upward - paddle moving upward from
          contact on
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>
        Drop Serves
        <span class="h2Note">(ball bounces on ground before serve)</span>
      </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The ball must drop freely, i.e. no momentum in any direction</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hits</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If, as part of your swing, the ball hits your hand below the wrist
          while you're holding the paddle in that hand, it's not a fault
        </li>
        <li>
          Double hits are legal on the pickleball courts if they're (1)
          <em>unintentional</em>, (2) continuous, (3) a single-direction stroke
          and (4) by just one player
        </li>
        <li>You may hit the pickleball with two-hands on your paddle</li>
        <li>You may switch your paddle between hands at any time</li>
        <li>Can't use two paddles though</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kitchen (Non-Volley Zone, NVZ)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The kitchen includes all lines around the kitchen</li>
        <li>
          Most misunderstood rule of the game: you may not enter the kitchen on
          a volley, meaning if you hit the ball on a fly you may not step in the
          kitchen
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If, before hitting the ball, you were in the kitchen, you must get
            both feet on the ground outside the kitchen before hitting the ball
          </li>
          <li>
            After you hit the ball, if momentum carries you into the kitchen,
            that is a fault - no matter how delayed your entry to the kitchen.
            This is the only time I know of that you can fault after the ball is
            dead
          </li>
          <li>
            Your partner may save you from falling into the kitchen provided she
            does not enter the kitchen in the process
          </li>
          <li>
            If anything on your person - hat, spare ball, paddle, keys... -
            drops into the kitchen, that is a fault. I.e. you can't throw
            something forward to generate back momentum to keep yourself from
            falling into the kitchen
          </li>
          <li>
            You can't use your paddle or any other object to prop yourself up
            and prevent your entry into the kitchen
          </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h2>Net & Bars</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you touch any part of the net system while the ball is live, it's a
          fault
        </li>
        <li>
          You (or your paddle or other item that you are wearing or carrying)
          may not cross the plane of the pickleball net (or the imaginary
          extension line of the pickleball net beyond the nets posts) before you
          have hit the pickleball (one exception, see below)
        </li>
        <li>Temporary net: ball hits top of center pole: treat as net ball</li>
        <li>Temporary net: ball hits horizontal bar or center foot:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>before going over net = fault</li>
          <li>after going over net = do over</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <h2>Odd Shots & Odd Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Apart from the above considerations related to kitchen faults, if any
          item falls off you and onto your side of the pickleball court, then no
          fault occurs. Further, there is no fault or dead ball even if the
          pickleball hits any such item
        </li>
        <li>No clothing may be worn that matches the color of the ball (!)</li>
        <li>
          "The Erne" is a shot where you hit the pickleball either (1) in the
          air as you are jumping over the kitchen to out of bounds or (2) after
          you establish your feet out of bounds, just to the side of the
          kitchen.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you hit the ball “around-the-post” from your out of bounds, the
          ball may travel below the net and still be good
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is enough wind or backspin to cause the ball to land on your
          side of the court, then bounce back to the other side without you
          touching it, this is a point for your opponent. (This is the only case
          where you may cross to the opponents' side before hitting the ball -
          typically by reaching over the net)
        </li>
        <li>
          If there is an injury during a rally on the pickleball court, then
          play continues until the end of the rally
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Other Weird Occurrences</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the server hits the receiver's partner with the ball, it is a point
          for the serving team
        </li>
        <li>
          If a pickleball is cracked or broken during a rally, then the players
          on the pickleball court should continue play until the end of the
          rally. After the rally has ended players decide if the ball is
          compromised and a redo is needed
        </li>
