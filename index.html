    <h2>Additional Wellesley Courts</h2>
    <p>
      One of our main goals is to support the town in its efforts to bring more
      pickleball courts to Wellesley. Recently the Advisory Committee voted 14-0
      to recommend that $70,000 be allocated toward a study to evaluate various
      options for new court construction, including dedicated pickleball courts
      at Morses Pond. The town is also exploring options for dedicated courts at
      Hunnewell Field. We hope to see the study approved and funded at the
      Special Town Meeting on November 6th.
