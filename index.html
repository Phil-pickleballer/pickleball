    <h2>Additional Wellesley Courts</h2>
    <p>
      <em>BIG WIN FOR PICKLEBALL</em>: One of our main goals is to support the
      town in its efforts to bring more pickleball courts to Wellesley. At its
      November 2023 Town Meeting, members approved $70,000 in funding "To
      establish criteria and determine feasibility for siting picklelball courts
      in Wellesley." Options include dedicated pickleball courts at Morses Pond,
      at Hunnewell Field and other locations around town.
